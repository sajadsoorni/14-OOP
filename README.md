# JavaScript OOP Practice Repo 👨‍💻

This repo is where I practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript. I’m currently following the fantastic [Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNINGGB) by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy, and I created this repo to solidify my understanding.

## What I'm Practicing 🛠️

In this repo, I’m working through:

- Constructor functions
- Prototypes and prototype inheritance
- ES6 classes
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Polymorphism

The exercises and examples here are inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann’s original [OOP project on GitHub](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course/tree/master/14-OOP).
